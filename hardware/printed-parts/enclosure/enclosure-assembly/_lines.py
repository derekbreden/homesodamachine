"""_lines — the runs the box carries, authored port to port.

[`_routing.py`](_routing.py) is the kit; this file is the authorship: one `route(...)` per
connection, its waypoints written against the ports and body faces that shape them.

Today: the sealed refrigerant loop (`scorecard.REFRIGERANT_SEGMENTS`), all three legs, binding
the three placed components — compressor, condenser, cold-core evaporator. Two corridors carry
it, each measured off the faces that bound it:

  * the machine corridor — 49 mm, compressor back face to cold-core front face. Its approach
    lane rides one bend radius off the cold-core face; refrig-2 crosses it at the floor,
    refrig-3 drops down it at the suction's station.
  * the condenser channel — 21 mm, compressor +X face to condenser −X face, one lane wide.
    refrig-1 crosses at the discharge's height and climbs the tipped block's flank to the
    back-top inlet; refrig-2 leaves the front-bottom outlet along the channel floor — the two
    share the lane plane 69 mm apart in z.

A 1/4" line runs one bend radius of straight (12.7 mm) off a fitting before it turns.
